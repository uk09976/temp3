Yesterday we received the following email into our email box <Products.Support@cybg.com>.  We are no longer using this inbox and I believe this has already been cascaded but may have missed your area.  For future communications please could you email the response to the following email address MTSavingsPPD@cybg.com
Please let me know if you have any issues as we are no longer monitoring the Product Support inbox 
Many thanks, Helen priestley
