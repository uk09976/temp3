
Scenario 1  - Contains duplicate NINO and DOB -The system is rejecting all of these records although this is correct  in some cases a further rule needs to be applied to check if a unique account number.  In the event there is a different /unique account number for the duplicate NINO/DOB records then the records should not be rejected .

Scenario 2 - National Insurance Number" must be present and be in the correct format (space is allowed as 9th character).
The system is rejecting due to the NINO suffix not being A,D ,C,D however the scheme rules have never applied this to the data 
And there are records with NINOS ending with Q etc.  SSIS needs amended to allow all suffix characters.

Scenario 3 -Dummy NIN0 – The system is rejection dummy NINO’s   QQ123456Q
                                                                                                               XX999999X

These are currently handled by the exception process , we were asked to  make this enhancement however the team have not 
Advised the providers so this needs to be mothballed until the team have communicated to lenders. 
“ We can add the following message.    A  dummy NINO has been identified when processing your submission, we will process            the record on this occasion but please update the correct NINO for future submissions”
